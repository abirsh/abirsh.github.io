		<h1>Merging Audio Clips and Manipulating Audio Effects</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome! The topic for this activity is: merging multiple audio clips and manipulating audio effects. Under this topic, we'll do three subtasks - merge two audio clips on the same track, pan the audio all the way to the right, and turn on reverb. And for this, we are working with a GarageBand project that has a single audio track. The track has two audio clips - one between 0 to 4 seconds, and the other between 4 to 18 seconds.
		</p>
		<h2>Subtask 1: Merging Multiple Audio Clips</h2>
		<p>The first subtask is to merge all the audio clips on the track. To do that, follow these steps: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Press the Up arrow to make sure the track is selected. </li>
			<li>Press Control-A to select all the audio clips on this track. </li>
			<li>Now, press Command-J, which is the keyboard shortcut for merging audio regions. If it works, Voiceover will say “join regions notes”.</li>
			<li>We’ve completed the first subtask! </li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Subtask 2: Panning Audio to the Right</h2>
		<p>Now, let’s play with some audio effects. For the second subtask, we will pan the audio track to the right. This means, if you wear a headphone, it would seem like the sound is coming entirely from your right-hand side. To do that, follow these steps: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Use Control-Option-Right Arrow to go to the “Tracks” area. Interact with “Tracks” by pressing control-option-shift-down arrow.</li>
			<li>Inside “Tracks”, there will be five items. Using Control-Option-Right arrow, Navigate to the fourth item called “Tracks Header”.</li>
			<li>Interact with “Tracks Header” by pressing Control-Option-Shift-Down arrow - and you should hear VoiceOver say, “in tracks header. Track 1 - rice.”</li>
			<li>Interact with “Track 1, Rice” by pressing Control-Option-Shift-Down arrow. Inside, use Control-Option-Right arrow navigate to the last item called “Pan 0”. This is the panning knob.</li>
			<li>Interact with the panning knob using Control-Option-Shift-Down arrow. Then keep pressing Control-Option-Right arrow, until it says “63 of 63, right channel pan.”</li>
			<li>If you can’t go farther than 63, then you have successfully panned the audio all the way to the right.</li>
			<li>We’ve completed the second subtask! </li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Subtask 3: Applying Reverb</h2>
		<p>Now, for the third subtask, let’s add another effect called the reverb - which gives your audio a fuller and richer vibe. To find the reverb effect and turn it on, follow these steps: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring up the item chooser by pressing Control-Option-I. Type “master” using your keyboard to narrow down the list of items. Choose “Master Reverb” from the remaining options and press Enter. </li>
			<li>Now you will have the text label of "Master Reverb" selected - the actual master reverb checkbox is on its left. So, press Control-Option-Left once - to find “Master Reverb, checkbox”, which is currently unchecked. </li>
			<li>Press Control-Option-Space once - to turn on the “Master Reverb.”</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Great! We’ve completed all the subtasks of this activity. Now you know how to merge audio clips and apply some effects. Goodbye!</p>
