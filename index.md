## Hi! I'm Abir.
I am a PhD student in [Technology and Social Behavior (TSB)](http://tsb.northwestern.edu/), a joint Computer Science and Communication Studies program at [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu/). I work in the [Inclusive Technology Lab](http://inclusive.northwestern.edu/) with [Dr. Anne Marie Piper](http://ampiper.soc.northwestern.edu/).

Previously, I completed my Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at [Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)](http://www.iupui.edu) and obtained my Bachelor degree (B.Sc.) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](http://www.buet.ac.bd/).

My research interests include Human-Computer Interaction, Accessibility and Assistive Technology. In my research, I study and design tools to support creative work practices of people with vision impairments.

I am passionate about traveling and photography. Backpacking through Western Europe, New Zealand and Patagonia is on my long-term travel bucket list. I have backpacked across the lovely country called Japan, and I plan to go back again. Through my camera and lens, I try to capture the juxtaposition of architecture, nature and humans as I travel through places and time. You can find me on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/abirsaha_).

# Research
**ACCESSIBILITY IN AUDIO PRODUCTION FOR PEOPLE WITH VISION IMPAIRMENTS**
*Mentor: [Dr. Anne Marie Piper](https://ampiper.soc.northwestern.edu/)*

In this project, I'm interested in understanding how people with vision impairments use mainstream and custom-made software and hardware tools to produce audio content. Taking their current work practices into account, I aim to design accessible tools to support their workflow.
<br/>
**AUTISM SUPPORT SMART TECHNOLOGY FOR CHILDREN**    
*Mentors:  [Dr. Shameem Ahmed](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~ahmeds/)  and  [Dr. Moushumi Sharmin](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~sharmim/)*

In this project, we did a systematic literature review and qualitative coding of scholarly articles regarding smart technologies (wearables, smartphones, VR devices etc.) designed to support autistic children. We devised a set of design implications to guide the development of autism support smart technologies.
<br/>
**DEVELOPMENT OF TESTING METHODS FOR ROAD DEPARTURE WARNING SYSTEMS**  
*Mentor:  [Dr. Stanley Chien](http://www.engr.iupui.edu/main/people/detail.php?id=schien)*

In this project sponsored by  [Toyota Collaborative Safety Research Center](https://www.toyota.com/csrc/), I worked on the development of standard testing methods and scenarios to evaluate the performance of Road Departure Mitigation systems of autonomous vehicles.
